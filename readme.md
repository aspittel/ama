Hey! I'm Ali. I teach people to code full-time. Before that I was a software engineer focusing on building web applications for data science workflows. I'm mostly self-taught -- I took two computer science classes before starting to work in the industry. I also write a [blog](https://zen-of-programming.com/) about programming, so some questions may get longer form answers on there!

I get a lot of questions by email and via Twitter DM. This way anyone can read the answer!

Feel free to ask me whatever! Work. Life. Code. Etc!
